  The index specification document to use as the
  :doc:`shard key </core/sharding-shard-key/>`. The shard key
  determines how MongoDB distributes the documents among the shards.

  The *key* of the index specification document is the field to use as
  the shard key. The *value* of the document must be one of the
  following:

  - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`

  - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
    :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.

  Unless the collection is empty, the index must exist prior to the
  :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command. If the collection is empty,
  MongoDB creates the index prior to sharding the collection if the
  index that can support the shard key does not already exist.

  See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`

  When ``true``, the ``unique`` option ensures that the underlying index
  enforces a unique constraint. Hashed shard keys do not support unique
  constraints. Defaults to ``false``.

  Specifies the number of chunks to create
  initially when sharding an *empty* collection with a :ref:`hashed
  shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`. MongoDB will then create and
  balance chunks across the cluster. The ``numInitialChunks`` must be
  less than ``8192`` per shard.
  
  .. versionchanged:: 4.0.3
  
     The option has no effect if zones and zone ranges have been
     defined for the empty collection. See {{explanation}}.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.4

     If the collection is not empty or the shard key is not a hashed
     key, the operation returns an error.

  If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
  has a default :doc:`collation </reference/collation>`,
  you *must* include a collation document with
  ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or
  the ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
  whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
  collation.
